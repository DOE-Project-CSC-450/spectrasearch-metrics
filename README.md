| Gamut Index (Rg) | TM-30 | Compares the area enclosed by the average chromaticity coordinates in each of 16 hue bins to characterize the average saturation level of the test source compared to the reference illuminant. A neutral score is 100, with values greater than 100 indicating an increase in saturation and values less than 100 indicating a decrease in saturation. The range in values grows as fidelity decreases. | 1 |   | [Code](https://www.lrc.rpi.edu/programs/nlpip/lightinganswers/lightsources/scripts/NLPIP_LightSourceColor_Script.m) |
| Hue Fidelity IndicesRf,hj(j = 1 to 16) | TM-30 | Provides a numerical characterization of color fidelity in each of 16 hue bins (j), which can be used to evaluate how similarly the test source renders reds, yellows, greens, blues, or in-between hues compared to the reference. Values range from 0 to 100. Specificvalues may be used to supplement average values if one hue type is of particular concern. Specifying limits for all values is also possible. These scores are analogous to the special indices of the CRI system (e.g., R9), but are more robust because they combineseveral samples with different spectral features. | 1 | [slide 22](https://assets.website-files.com/57698e8d8a6044ef2ce2d17b/5bc842dfe3e80e99724e7b20_SMET_TM30.pdf) |   |

| Chroma Change by HueIndicesRcs,hj (j = 1 to 16) | ™-30 | Provides numerical values for relative chroma change in each of 16 hue bins (j), which can be used to evaluate saturation (positive values) or desaturation (negative values) of reds, yellows, greens,blues, and in-between hues compared to the reference. Supplementary criteria could be set for all values, or just specific values,such as red (bin 1). | 3 |   |   |
| Skin Fidelity IndexRf,skin | ™-30 | Characterizes the similarity of skin tones (CES15 and CES18) as rendered by the test source compared to the reference source.Values range from 0 to 100. Rf,skin can be used to supplement other values when skin is an important consideration. | 3 |   |   |
| Sample Fidelity IndicesRf,CESi(i = 1 to 99) | ™-30 | Characterizes the similarity of each CES (i) as rendered by the test source compared to the reference source. Values range from 0 to 100. Individual values may have little predictive power for other objects, but examining the scores in a combined chart can indicate the source&#39;s object-to-object consistency. | 3 |   |   |
