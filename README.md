| CIE 1931 | Chromaticity Coordinates  | The CIE system characterizes colors by a luminance  parameter Y and two color coordinates  x and y which specify the point on the chromaticity diagram The diagram given here is associated with the 1931 CIE standard. Revisions were made in 1960 and 1976, but the 1931 version remains the most widely used version. 
| CCT | Correlated Color Temperature | CCT is essentially a gauge of how yellow or blue the color of light appears. i.e. What point is it closest to on the blackbody locus?
| CRI | Color Rendering Index | CRI is a scale from 0 to 100 percent indicating how accurate a "given" light source is at rendering color when compared to a "reference" light source.
| GAI | Gamut Area Index | Defined as the area enclosed within three or more chromaticity coordinates in a given color space. For purposes of color rendering, GA is usually calculated from the area of the polygon defined by the chromaticities of the eight CIE standard color samples, the same reference samples used to calculate color rendering index  in CIE 1976.
| FSCI | Full Spectrum Color Index | A mathematical measure of how much a light source's spectrum deviates from an equal-energy spectrum. An equal-energy spectrum is an imaginary spectrum that provides the same radiant power at all wavelengths, thus representing a "full" spectrum.
